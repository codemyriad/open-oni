### Fixed

- Various UTF8 fixes have been applied to allow emojis into the database (these
  are more and more common in born-digital publications)

### Migration

- You'll have to run database migrations, and they may take a while depending
  on the size of your `core_languagetext` data.
  - On ~60 gigs, it took UO roughly 45 minutes running on our production server
    while it was still serving up data to users
  - To determine your table's size, you can do something like this in a DB
    console: `SELECT table_name, ROUND((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) / 1024 /
    1024) AS SizeMB FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA =
    'openoni' AND TABLE_NAME = 'core_languagetext';`
- Make sure if you're overriding the Django `DATABASES` hash in your local
  settings that you pay close attention to the new `OPTIONS` setting in the
  base settings file! You'll need to get the `SET NAMES...` bit added to your
  `init_command` as well as the `charset` value, otherwise your overrides will
  effectively undo some required setup:
  ```
  'OPTIONS': {
    'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'; SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;",
    'charset': 'utf8mb4',
  },
  ```
